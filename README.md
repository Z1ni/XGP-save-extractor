Ready to get off game pass and join the Steam master race without having to restart everything?

This is a script that converts Starfield Xbox PC game saves into Steam game saves.

You do not need to place it in the save folder - and it will generate a zip.

Unzip and copy the files into your Steam save folder: %userprofile%\Documents\My Games\Starfield\Saves

Done!

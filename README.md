# XGP-save-extractor
Python script to extract/backup savefiles out of Xbox Game Pass for PC games.

When run, the script produces a ZIP file for each supported game save found in the system.

In most cases the files in the ZIP can be copied to the save directory of the Steam/Epic version of the game. To find out the save file location, check [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want the script to support another game, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/Z1ni/XGP-save-extractor/issues/new/choose).

> Check the [incompatible game list](#incompatible-games) below and search the issues for a duplicate before creating a new one.

## Incompatible games

## Running
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the save file extraction fails, wait for a bit and try again. The Xbox cloud save sync can take some time and produce invalid files while syncing is in progress.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some anti-virus/anti-malware software can flag the executable as malicious. The executable is produced with [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/) and contains the Python interpreter alongside with the same `main.py` script as in this repo.

Download the latest release for an one-file executable: https://github.com/Z1ni/XGP-save-extractor/releases

*Or*

Run `main.py` with Python 3.10+. The script produces ZIP files for each of the supported games that are installed for the current user.
